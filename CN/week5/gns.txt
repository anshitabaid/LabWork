IP adress 32 bit integer

2 ways it can be used
class 4 addressing 
a, b, c, d
first three classes are used for ono to one communication
class d is used for multicasting

classes are identified with the most significant bit -> if it is 0 it is class A network
							if it is 10 it is class B network
							if it is 110 it is class C network

the suffix and prefix are fixed for each class

prefix <- identifies network
suffix <- identifies host in a network (no of ip addresses available to you)
_________ _______________ _____________________ ___________________________________ _____________________________________

Class A : 2^8 networks, 2^24 hosts
Class B : 2^16 networks, 2^16 hosts
Class C : 2^24 networks, 2^8 hosts (number of networks are more, addresses are less)
 
suffix : A -> 8 Bit
	B -> 16 Bit
	C -> 24 Bit

example - 192.18.22.72 

Class A
starts with 10.x.x.x

Class C 
first address -> 192.18.22.0 (known as network address)
last address -> 192.18.22.255 (known as multicasting, broadcasting address)

The role of the mask (suffix all bits are one, prefix all bits are zero) -> it is possible to derive the network id from the mask and then the routing happens. 

AND any address with the mask, and that will result in the network address -> MASK: 255.255.255.0

Classless Notation
172.16.22.27/24

there is no classes but you have to mention the /notation -> cunstruct the network mask and calculate the network id.
prefix length is 24 <- using as a class c address

range of the address are 
10.0.1.100/24

mask: prefix are 1, suffix are 0 -> 255.255.255.0

10.0.1.100 x 255.255.255.0 -> 10.0.1.0

therefore range is: 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255


10.0.1.100/28

10.0.1.(01100100) x 255.255.255.(11110000) -> 10.0.1.(01100000) 

10.0.1.96

concept of routing, first find the network id and then locate the host. (look into the router table if there is any information with the corresponding id and then take appropriate action)

as the prefix length decreases the network size becomes bigger

if you ping from smaller network to larger network it wont be successful.
